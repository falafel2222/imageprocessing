Fun with creating intelligent* mosaics out of images

## How to use it

1. Make sure you have both packages pillow and svgwrite installed
2. Put .jpg images in a folder inside the main directory called img
3. Change the variables at the top of each file to customize the way the algorithms create each modified image 

## Example

#### Original Image:

![Original Image](/readme_images/original.png)

#### Triangled Image:

#### Freeform Image:

*The mosaic creation is not actually intelligent. No machine learning of any sort is used.
